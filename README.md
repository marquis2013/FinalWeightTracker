# FinalWeightTracker

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?  
   This is a basic weight tracker app design to log each individual's weight loss or gain journey. 
 
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designssuccessful?
 This workout track need some basic requirements to complete the project. The first screen had to be a login screen with the ability to create a new user. The next screen should be a notification request so the user can receive updates when the user hits there weight goal. Finally, the app requires a screen to log the users weights.  
 
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
 Coding is still pretty new to me so I took each screen at a time. Turns out YouTube can be an amazing teacher if you are ever stuck. Compartmentalizing is important for keeping organized and managing your time.  

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
 Android studio has a great emulator system (well it really the only emulator I have used) but I was able to run the app and test it functions with that.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The coding process is still difficult for me, the creative process and the UI designing comes easy to me because I'm a creative person. The way I overcame my challenges was by have YouTube as my teacher.
    
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think the design looks great and I'm most proud of it compared to the rest of the app. Honestly, I could have done even better if I managed my time better.
